Ayurvedic Clinic Website
------------------------

This project is a full-stack web application developed for an Ayurvedic clinic to manage and present healthcare services in a structured and user-friendly manner. The website provides an intuitive interface for patients to explore Ayurvedic treatments, view clinic information, and interact with essential features through a responsive design.
The backend is built using Python (Django), which handles URL routing, business logic, database interactions, and secure user authentication. The frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly user experience. JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and improve client-side validation.
Key features include dynamic page rendering, form handling, secure data management, and an organized modular structure following Django’s MVC (MTV) architecture. The project demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack web development concepts, including backend–frontend integration, responsive UI design, and scalable application structure.
